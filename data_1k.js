Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert.

The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country.

			'In July 2003 I flew London (Gatwick)-Ljubljana-Skopje return in Business Class. Overall I was quite impressed. All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.',

			"I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.",

			'I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.',

			"I recently flew to Mykonos through Athens and must say it was a very pleasant experience. The Zurich - Athens - Zurich legs were in Business class, to which I was upgraded for free being a Gold Member of their program Miles and Bonus. During the inbound flight I was served a 4 course menu, with 2 choices for the main course, with excellent wines, return flight was in the morning, so breakfast with 2 choices of eggs (scrambled and omelette), fresh fruit platter, greek yoghourt and bread. Responsible for the Business class section was every time the Maitre de cabine, who was very attentive and kind. Flights were on time (ish) and transfer in Athens was easy and smooth, even though inbound luggage could not be through-checked because of the lack of customs in Mykonos Airport (it was on return though). Only slight downside was check-in at Mykonos at 6 am, with only 2 counters open and queue moving very slowly, taking me 20 minutes to check-in my suitcase.

There was no in-flight wi-fi, so good thing I brought a book. First class inflight meal (EI134) was good, but first selection (beef) was unavailable. Inflight meal on EI135 was positively inedible except for the roll - not even dressing for the salad. First choice of meals on EI135 (chicken) was unavailable again.

The business class has little to do with business class. Apart from the food it looks like economy class. The only difference is that there is a reclined table at the middle seat shared by the two side passengers. No personal entertainment system either just newspapers.

Yet, I hoped that if the flight wasn't fully booked the staff would be flexible and allow me to sit in an exit row. Years of flying have continued to confirm to me that if you want service and flexibility, go with the \"legacy\" airlines, as opposed to the \"low-cost\" ones where you have to pay for everything. Once again, I politely asked and the Aer Lingus staff happily obliged - on both trips. As such, I was very pleased for the quality I got on this short-haul flight within the UK.

Plane took off on time and arrived a few minutes early on the other side, so no complaints there. Boarding was relatively quick and the cabin crew were personable, one passenger complained of being ill during the flight and was attended to with care and attention. A hassle free trip but they do need more space between seats on their planes, this is a national airline, not a budget one.',

On the 16th from Kalymnos to Athens and back to Mykonos and then on 22nd Mykonos - Athens - to Irakio Crete and then from Crete back to Athens. I must say I have had some excellent flights with Aegean. All flights on time and an excellent meal from London to Athens and this being Economy. On the internal flights you were offered a soft drink and snack. Cabin crews were extremely professional and I look forward to next October. The only downside is that: 1) They did not show any films or music available on the London flight and 2) When I booked in March I could not book the November flight home because tickets were not available so BA flew me home. I knocked a point off their food and beverages as they don't serve a gin and tonic in Economy. AS I have said I look forward to flying with them next year but they have changed the flight times to Mykonos from Athens from 7 pm to 6.30 pm which makes life difficult so they might lose this customer.",

			"SFO-DUB, LHR-DUB-SFO. Ground staff excellent. On time departure. Flight staff were just going through the motions and seemed as though they couldn't care less about the passengers. Seating was tight, but bearable. Inflight entertainment was pretty good. Meals were not so good and beverage service was below standard. Had issues with passenger behind us that allowed their child to continuously kick the back of our seat. We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time. Ground staff friendly and helpful, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and outgoing. Meals were actually tasty and there were non-stop beverage runs. The crew came across happy and willing to please the passengers. I got on the plane dreading the flight but departed with a positive attitude. Seating is tight though.

It was okay and what one would expect of an airline meal. SNN-LHR and FCO-DUB were on A320s. The planes were clean but the seats were a little bit tight. There were no IFE on both flights and they charged for food and beverage. DUB-JFK on an A330 dual aisle plane. No pillow and blanket at my seat but they had blankets available for the passengers. The IFE was again sufficient for 7 hour flight. There was a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing. The boarding process on all 4 flights were effective and all 4 flights left on time.

It all starts from the arrival in the airport where Aegean counters for Business travelers and gold miles card holders are filled with people which means at least 30’mins waiting for your check in. The return journey to Tirana is being carried out with a DE HAVILLAND 8-400 airplane with very little space for passenger seats. Aegean is allowing everyone to have more than one piece of hand luggage therefore you have to fight for an overhead space in this tiny airplane otherwise you will end up with the luggage under you tiny seat. Finally this journey costs only 260 euro (return) if you don't check in any luggage otherwise you have to add roughly 80 euro to the price.",

So when I booked our trip in May 2015 to Italy through Dublin to Naples I was excited. I could not have been more disappointed. The service was terrible. There was only 1 flight attendant that gave a faint smile (and that was on all legs of the trip. A British staff member was on board for the final Dublin to Boston flight via Titan Airlines. They were a breath of fresh air and were very pleasant and actually smiled). The food was bad. The plane was pretty clean though. This was the cheapest airline I have flown on. They kept charging for everything. On the flight from Dublin to Naples they charged for every single thing even water. Not one thing was distributed for free. I could see if I paid very little for my flight but this was not a cheap rock bottom fare. Frankly I was ashamed of being Irish after I took the first leg of the trip. We were traveling with 10 other people and all agreed that they would have no interest in traveling to Ireland for a future vacation. So Aer Lingus - you might be saving a lot of money but you are obliterating anyone's desires to travel to Ireland in the future.",

I had previously paid for a seat upfront but only got row 9 in the reorg which was odd as there were spare seats on the earlier flight. Bad news - loads of planes leaving at that time so really only gained about half an hour but hey not their fault. Usual problem though - people with too much luggage and no idea of how to stow on board. They did weigh some and grab some but I feel they need to monitor this when people get on the plane as some people really are quite selfish and clueless.

The experience at Munich airport was very poor particularly the passport control line which was 45 minutes of unrestrained and uncontrolled pushing and shoving. Probably not Aer Lingus' fault but still a poor start. I had paid for a business class ticket over the internet. Did not find out until getting on the plane that the first part of the trip (Munich to Dublin) was economy as there are no business class seats on the plane. Typical economy experience. The actual business class portion of the trip (Dublin to Boston) was excellent. However the fare (which looked reasonable initially) in retrospect seemed far too high given that 3 hours of the 9 hour trip were actually not business class. I had a medical issue that caused me to book the business class ticket so I was really horrified at the unexpected 3 hours in economy which I had bought the business class ticket specifically to avoid.",

			'Flew Dublin Boston with 3 month old two year old and husband. Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior.

Checked in online was almost immediately sent an email and text informing me my flight was delayed 40 minutes. Arrive at the airport and am continuously informed of further delays. The plane was late getting in and they flipped it as quickly as they could somehow managing to get fresh blankets and pillows in every seat although they did not have time to get fresh headsets on board before takeoff. By the time we got off the ground we were 2 hours behind schedule. Despite this we were informed that we would only be half an hour behind schedule due to favorable weather. This was not the case we were over an hour late. Upon arrival in Dublin almost everyone on the plane were given tickets for new flights since literally all of us missed our connections due to the delays. I was booked on the next flight out of Dublin (which was still a 5 hour wait) and given vouchers in 5 euro increments for breakfast as compensation for the inconvenience. Everyone with whom I spoke during the delay the confusion and the ticket transferring was absolutely a joy seriously one of the best customer service experiences I have had while flying. The food on the flight was great for airline food and in the course of a 5 hour flight we were given a beverage and snack service dinner coffee/tea and morning juice.

			'SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.',

But this would not recognise our name booking reference or passport numbers. We tried again and again until eventually another member of staff sorted it for us. Not a good start as far as we were concerned I was fuming. Returning from Athens we encountered exactly the same problems with a check in machine there. This time even an assistant failed to operate the terminal and she subsequently instructed us to join a lengthy queue. Reaching the front 15 minutes later we were told we were in the wrong queue it was the Olympic desk and not Aegean which was the next one along. Our plea that we were in the queue we had been instructed to join by a member of staff was met with no sympathy whatsoever. With us on the verge of going ballistic the person at the correct desk was thankfully sympathetic and helpful. Everything on our flights was as expected though I must comment that there was less legroom than I have ever before experienced on a plane. As a tall person (5 ft 11 in / 180 cm inside leg 33 in / 84 cm) I spent the entire flight with my knees jammed firmly either side of the seat in front of me and unable to move.',

It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to \"buy\" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly. I will not fly Aer Lingus transatlantic anymore when there are much better options.

Service is good, lunch is good (even special vegetarian meal), entertainment system is available and with a large choice. And the Russian hospitality is smiling and attentive to the guests. Had a good time on the first part of my trip. Changed planes in Moscow. Priority lane works well if the connecting flight is with Aeroflot. Moscow-Ulan Bator left on time. Seats on the Boeing 737-800 are only to be used for short distances, less than 4 hours. Mine was a medium haul flight of 6 hours. A night flight with chairs not to be used for sleeping. No real business class flat bed seat on these planes. A great pity. The service is good, dinner/breakfast is good (even the special meal for a vegetarian), entertainment system is available and with a large choice .

			"Dublin to Paris CDG return. I paid for a flexible ticket which costs more than twice the ordinary fare. By right this should be equivalent to business class fare. However Aer Lingus operates an economy only seating on this route. It used to include 2 checked bangs of 20 kgs each. Not anymore as you only get one 20kg bag now. With this fare you get lounge access but you still have to purchase food and drinks on the plane. Outbound flight was largely ok. On the return trip I was very annoyed to discover that the overhead bin was full and as I was on seat 1C there was no front seat I could put my small carry on luggage under. Eventually the stewardess managed to squeeze it in an overhead bin above the seat behind. I find this unacceptable as obviously no proper checks were carried out allowing people to carry disproportionately more stuff on board and thus depriving others from getting their fare share of space. It irritated me even more that I had paid over the odds to discover that there was no space for my small carry on luggage above my seat. I have to agree with strict policies regarding carry on luggage as is with Ryanair. I guess I will still continue flying Aer Lingus as there are not too many options on this route but Aer Lingus should probably have a small business class cabin so that those who pay more get that bit more for the extra they fork out for their ticket. Alas I am unlikely to see this in my lifetime. In summary I think the worst thing an airline can do is combining a low cost approach while still charging extra for which you don't get much more. If Aer Lingus wants to be a real low cost airline that's fine but don't charge more and give nothing much in return.",

			"Our nonstop flight from LED to SXF was cancelled some weeks before travel and we were re-booked on a flight via SVO which meant approximately twice the original flight time, but we had no problem getting to know a new airport. The flight from LED to SVO had a delay and although we were told that the connecting flight would wait for us as (because of the re-booking) there would be a large group of SXF passengers on board, it did not. But directly upon entering SVO airport a SU representative would hand out pre-printed new boarding passes and a beverage voucher, so no need to go to a transfer desk. I found that quite professional. The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though). The sparkling airports in LED and SVO but Berlin's SXF trashy airport to shame.

			"We travelled Newcastle-Dublin-Chicago early October and chose Aer Lingus because of the option to do Immigration in Dublin. What a disappointment. At US Immigration in Dublin we were handed Customs Forms. The guy handing them out had no idea what they were for or who had to fill them in. The Immigration process however was fairly straightforward and much quicker than we've experienced in the US. Once on board what a disappointment. We waited almost two hours before the flight attendants came around with the drinks trolley. They only came around once in an eight hour flight. And we had to pay for the drinks. This is the first time we've had to do this on a Transatlantic flight. They never came around with complimentary water or juice. I asked the attendant for some water which she brought to me but when the lady in front asked for water she was told they'd stopped serving drinks!! Lunch was pretty grim and afternoon tea was a flapjack - pretty hard to swallow when you're thirsty! On a positive note when we landed in Chicago we collected our luggage and were on our way pretty quickly. The return overnight flight was no better then our flight from Dublin to Newcastle was delayed because of an incident in Dublin airport. We were sitting in a very cold aircraft for over an hour. The pilot said he would start the engines to warm the plane up - the propellors turned twice! When we got home I had a query and needed to speak to Customer Service. I filled in a Customer Service form - 4 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response.",

This was true even on the connecting economy flight to Amsterdam despite the seating being very tight and the flight was packed. Flights departed and left on time. Boarding was more chaotic as patrons waited while families with infants and those in wheelchairs boarded early but brought with them large extended families as well to take advantage of the early boarding. October 25 the return flight from Amsterdam only allows check in with KLM but Aer Lingus passengers find out too late that they cannot print boarding passes from the hotel but only at blue KLM machines in the airport. On return to Orlando in the time it took to walk for the gate to baggage Aer Lingus already had the bags on the conveyor belt. Now that's a first.",

In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers. While I had a problem free flight, I saw a number of other passengers struggle to sort out problems with ground staff at the SVO transfer desk.",

The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase!

			'Flew CWL-DUB-JFK and YYZ-DUB-CWL business class. Had the opportunity to bid for upgrade which we did and was accepted. The flight from CWL was on Stobart Air new plane and surprisingly quite a bit of leg room and seat comfort. We chose this route so we could clear immigration in DUB which was very easy to do and then sit in the BC lounge until ready to fly. The trip over was great comfortable seats which laid flat wi-fi 5 course meal on real plates and a tasty snack before we landed. The cabin crew were delightful nothing was too much trouble. The IFE was ok I mainly listened to music which had some great artists on there and some relatively new releases. I did not watch a film as I was too busy playing email tag with friends taking advantage of the wi-fi. Arrived at JFK on time and breezed through the terminal to collect luggage and to meet our waiting transfer. Return journey YYZ-DUB-CWL. Business lounge in YYZ airport is run by KLM massive lounge with great selection of food and drinks. The return plane was a different configuration and older so BC was not as comfortable in my opinion. There were only 12 seats and 2 were empty we were in row 1 and the screen for the IFE was so far away I could barely see it. One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over. Dinner was served it was ok but not to the standard of the outward flight and the seats were not as comfortable due to the fact that when you did use the recline/lie flat you were placed at an angle that made you feel as if you were about to slide on the floor. During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied "oh you said you did not want breakfast". When we arrived at DUB we had to go through security again despite having just gotten off a plane and only being in transit. Due to the plane being slightly late we only had 15mins to get to our gate. Our bags were scrutinised and my friends duty free was checked to see if the seal had been broken and the receipt matched with the label. Very irritating we did end up being slightly late to our gate (we had our boarding passes) but it was stress we could have done without.

So we could not watch a single movie during our 10 hour flight. At least no movie with sound. Food was standard. Neither good nor bad. I would not complain if the price would have been low. But it was pretty much the same as other airlines like Emirates or Etihad. 1/10 will never fly with Aeroflot again.',

			"ARN-SVO-BKK return on new A320 and B773. Flights more or less on time. No problem with transfer. Good in-flight entertainment on B773. Food in economy just OK. We got an upgrade to Comfort class on BKK-SVO which was great. Big seats and plenty of leg room. Food also better - but not sure if better because of Comfort class or because made in Thailand. I don't like Aeroflots bread buns wrapped in plastic. They ought to have fresh bread. I also think all passengers on all long haul flights ought to be given 05 litres of water in bottles. Only difference to other European 3 and 4 star carriers appears to be the no alcohol policy. If a bit better food - and maybe a bit better English for some staff Aeroflot could easily be a 4 star airline.",

			"We booked and paid for a package in May 2013 to fly to Munich in Dec 2013. Flight out was with Lufthansa which was great. However when we tried to check in online the day before our return to Cyprus with Aegean through Athens we got an error message saying 'non valid ticket' and giving us a number to call. We called the number which was Lufthansa and the agent told us he could see our booking but couldn't check us in as the computer systems weren't compatible. We tried the Aegean online check in but still no joy. So we got to Munich airport 2.5 hours before our flight to check in only to be told we were on standby! We were assured that the gate personnel would sort it out to our satisfaction so we went through to the departure gates. The departure gate had changed but not updated on the terminal screen. When we finally found it the staff were very off hand about us being on standby even though we couldn't understand how we didn't have a seat when the whole thing had been booked and paid for 7 months earlier. After making a big fuss and having to wait until 5 mins before take off we finally managed to get on the plane but not seated together. Another passenger offered to swap seats so we did sit together in the end. Unfortunately we were supposed to transfer in Athens and were very concerned that we would have to go through the whole thing again and we actually refused to board the Athens plane until we were sure we had seats on the Athens to Cyprus plane. No acceptable explanation was given as to why we had been given the run-around and in fact we were made to feel that we were just making a fuss about nothing. The service on board was indifferent food was shoddy and we will never fly with Aegean again. We've flown a lot long and short haul and I can safely say this was the worst experience ever.",

			"Although I have been rooting for Aegean in the past these past months I have traveled RHO-ATH-RHO many times and each time the experience seems to be worsening. The boarding and flight schedules are perfectly fine if you ignore the constant use of a bus for boarding instead of jumping platforms in Athens but the cabin experience apart from the seat comfort which is ok is worse every time. The take off is usually ok. The trip to Rhodes lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the cabin crew are struggling to serve you. It looks as if with one hand they serve and with the other they collect what they have just served for landing. The crew are typically indifferent and tend not to smile. The catering is average but couldn't expect big things for a 50 minute flight. For now it progressively costs more money to travel with Aegean that what you actually get in return at least for these domestic routes.",

I just managed to get my next connection flight to Mytilini because it operates from the same airline and they were waiting for us. Aegean has monopolised the local aviation.

			'Flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from Buenos Aires. I used Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3, modern, large, with limited food options (salads, sandwiches, desserts). I was one of the first to board the plane, so I had to wait almost 30 mins to get any drink/welcome drink, without asking for it, FAs started to give drinks only after boarding was finished. Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class. Breakfast started 2 hrs before landing, again - boring tray with fruit salad, yoghurt, bread roll and almost shapeless croissaint, jam and hot omlet with... carrots. Horrible. Generally, very poor business class product. No PA from pilots for whole flight. Not recommended.',

The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter.

The staff were very courteous and announcements were made in Russian and English. The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music.

Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops. The cleanest airport I have ever been to with janitors cleaning the toilets constantly wiping down all chrome pillars in hallways. Sparkling clean. Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck.

			"Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now.

Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals.

Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen.

Cabin crew helpful and efficient. No alcohol policy on airline due to incidents with drunk passengers. But overall Aeroflot did a good job getting us from a to b via SVO. We would book again with Aeroflot. But a food upgrade would be nice.',

			"LHR-ATH-RHO and return October 2013. Checked in online for all flights and seat assignments honoured. Flights arrived on time or early. Boarding a little chaotic despite very strict adherence to boarding by rows. No queue jumping was allowed if your row hadn't been called you were not allowed to board. Yet somehow chaos and confusion reigned in the cabin partly because of the amount of hand luggage some passengers had been allowed to take on board and partly because every single flight was packed solid. In flight service was excellent if a little slow. Hot meals served on international flights (ok quality) free (and good) Greek wine available and refills willingly given. Fight attendants universally pleasant and service oriented. A321 on international flights with inflight entertainment on drop down screens. A320 on domestic service. Check in at LHR and RHO easy and quick. Baggage delivery prompt. All in all very pleasant.",

			'London Stansted-Athens-Thessaloniki. Once again although cabin experience with this airline is good check-in process seems to be its weak point. Flight departed Stansted on time but just before landing at Athens I realised that I did not have a boarding pass for the connecting flight. I spoke to cabin crew about it but they seemed unaware of any issues/processes and simply referred me to the connecting flight desk at the airport. When I got there this was shut. There was no one available from the airline either and I ended up speaking to airport security. I was told that I had to come out of the airport security controlled area and check in all over again to get the boarding pass and that this is a standard procedure even though bags get transferred on to next flight automatically. There was a queue from hell at check-in which seems to be the norm for Aegean. I have never been asked to check in twice at airport for connecting flights. This then caused problems with my airport shopping not getting through security and I had to pick up my bag re-pack and hand in again. This involved a long and time- consuming process walking up and down the airport\'s different floors etc. Ground staff were understanding and did their best to help but there is no two ways about it: this was a very poorly "organised" connecting flight. I sent a form to customer service to complain but they just said that the problem was at Stansted and that they have rectified it. I asked how they have rectified it but they just responded by repeating the same. I am not convinced. A hassle-free flight with Aegean seems impossible and the overall experience does not correspond to what you pay. I would not recommend. On the way back with Air Berlin connecting at Dusseldorf did not give any problems and was a pleasure to walk past the Aegean packed check-in area knowing I didn\'t have to brave it.',

We were stranded in Istanbul airport for 12 hours with no offer of food or drink and no concrete solution from Aegean. Eventually at 3am the morning we were given a hotel. We slept for 4 hours. We then rushed back to the airport the next morning finally guaranteed a flight and arrived back just in time for work on Monday 6am. We were suppose to be there the previous morning (Sunday). Aegean made no effort to book us decent seats leaving us to sit apart the entire journey home as a result I didn't sleep at all during the flight. Therefore I had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and had to go straight in to work. The representative also lied to us to keep us happy until we left and could do nothing about it. We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing. I would suspect that the reason the flight was delayed in the first place was that there was no pilot thus a stand-in pilot was used.",

			"I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.",

I hadn't even informed them that it was missing because I checked my seat area and was fairly sure that it wasn't there. Honestly I don't even know how they managed to figure out whose phone it was. They may have had to call multiple people in our area of the plane. Anyway I went back to the airport and remarkably, they had my phone. I was relieved and extremely impressed.

On the return flight from Heraklion a cramped airport check-in-area full of returning holiday-makers: as a home-airport for the airline I would expect more than only one check-in being available for two simultaneously departing flights (MUC & CDG) resulting in horrible waiting queues. Additionally all passengers including those who managed to self-check-in and proceed to a "bag-drop-desk" had to queue a second time to take their luggage to only one open x-ray station themselves - another queuing disaster in an already overcrowded waiting hall. In total the check-in and "bag-drop" process on this particular flight consumed nearly two hours in cretan summer heat. I think Aegean could certainly do better by doubling the check-in-staff (opening a second counter) and making sure that passengers can actually drop their bags at the bag-drop.

The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place. Overall the flight was incredibly relaxing and I would book long haul with Aer Lingus in a heartbeat for flying out of Dublin the service is exceptional and business class was an unforgettable experience.',

			"Went back to US on an 11.50 am flight from Dublin to Boston. Worst flight I have had. 3 out of 6 hours of my flight was spent having to listen to a toddler with his non-stop and very loud crying which the parents didn't exert much effort to stop on top of a seat that doesn't recline. My back hurts so bad. This is just one of the minor things the airline should have a regular maintenance check on to provide more comfort to their customers specially for a long flight.",

			"Have flown with Aer Lingus round trip from Boston to UK 3 times prior to our flight in August. The return trip from Dublin to Boston was not what we usually experience with Aer Lingus. The flight attendants were not helpful. They were slow distributing the snack which turned out to be only drinks didn't offer anyone a snack. They did not hand out blankets. Told passengers to get them themselves. Distributed the meal slowly and it was well into the flight before we ate. Ran out of choices so we got stuck with a beef meal that was inedible. The flight encountered some turbulence so seat belt naturally went on. Yet the pilot took his time turning that sign off when the turbulence cleared. It seemed like we were confined to our seats for most of the trip. That also seemed to make the attendants happy. They did not appear to enjoy their job at all that flight!",

			"I flew HKG-SVO-LED and back in the past week. The seats were really comfortable on both legs; however legroom could be improved (I'm 5\"8) and it was pretty cramped in the A330-300 however on the A320 the legroom was sufficient. Food was really good compared with other airlines and I was quite satisfied with Aeroflot's service. On the last flight from SVO-HKG that I took today all economy passengers received medium-haul amenity kits from Business class which was surprising as there was only a pair of slippers and eye-shades on the first leg. Overall I really enjoyed the flight and I'll definitely be taking Aeroflot again in the near future!",

			'I flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo with a stop-over en Moscow SVO. It was a very positive experience. Aeroflot has gone through a large modernization programme in the recent years and it was very evident when I travelled with them. Most of their fleet now consists of modern airliners such as the A320 the A330 and the Boeing 777. I flew on their A320 from CPH to SVO. For a short-haul flight the onboard service was extremely good compared to most European airlines. The food consisted of fresh bread cheese beef and a delicious cake and the cabin crew were serving cold and hot drinks throughout the whole flight. The crew was extremely friendly. Since the plane was only half full many of the passengers were lying down across the seats. The cabin crew immediately offered them blankets and pillows to make them more comfortable. This is the first time I have experienced this on a European flight. The transfer at SVO was smooth and easy. The airport has been renovated and now offers an easy access between the terminals without having to go outside the airport. The passport and security check took less than 10 minutes much to my surprise and I was now standing in Terminal D which had a wide selection of restaurants shops as well as free WiFi. The flight to Tokyo was on an A330. The interior felt fresh and new and the seats were very comfortable although for a tall guy such as myself the legroom left much to be desired but that is not the fault of the airline. The cabin crew on this flight were fluent in English and Japanese. Again very friendly people. There was a passenger in front of me who seemed rather anxious about flying and kept calling the crew throughout the whole flight. They never ignored his calls or talked bad to him. They kept smiling and did what they could to make him feel comfortable. The food was again very tasty and the menu offered both Russian and Japanese dishes and despite the rather cramped space I had a very comfortable flight to Tokyo. I have read many negative reviews about Aeroflot and I will not deny that people might have had some bad experiences but my opinion on Aeroflot is that it is a modern airline that offers some of the cheapest tickets in the world while maintaining a high standard in customer service. I have already booked my next flight with Aeroflot and I will continue to fly with them whenever possible.',

Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise.

			"SYD-EZE on 29/10/2013 and returned EZE-SYD on 22/01/2014. The check-in at Sydney was slow and inefficient. There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours. I would not recommend Aerolineas economy to anyone.",

After two security checks and a very slow US immigration Customs we went to the gate and the flight was delayed 90 minutes. Once on the plane it was freezing cold and there were no blankets on the seats for passengers. Cabin crew kept saying the heat would start soon but that never happened. We were travelling with kids and they were shivering. After repeatedly complaining the staff gave us some extra blankets which helped a little bit. We had ordered Hindu Vegetarian meals but we were given meals with chicken as they had no veggie meals onboard and nobody was apologetic. On this long flight we were given only one tasteless meal that the kids hardly ate and one snack bar before landing. No snacks or treats for kids during the flight.

I check it when that time comes and the flight has been rescheduled and conflicted with my connecting flight in Mexico City (both Arrival and departure).

			"My wife daughter and I travelled from Gatwick to Chicago via Dublin on 23rd July. The flight to Dublin had 'no frills' but was more comfortable than a recent flight on another Irish budget airline. The 3 hours transfer time at Dublin was partially taken up with clearing US immigration and the rest with sitting waiting for the on time flight to Chicago. The cabin crew were mature and efficient and the meal was very acceptable and served two hours into the flight. When we arrived on time in Chicago because all the paperwork had been done we were able to walk out of the airport without hassle after collecting our baggage. The return flight on 14th August had a younger cabin crew who provided a more lively friendly but equally efficient service. The Beef meal was very tasty and the cheese and ham croissant just before landing was welcome. A word of warning during the transfer at Dublin outbound and inbound further scanning was carried out on our hand baggage. The duty free bottle was accepted as the seal on the bag had not been broken and we had the receipt but a small bottle of wine from the aircraft which I had kept to drink later was confiscated even though it was unopened. I had read some of the 'horror reviews before flying but our experience did not match them and we would happily fly with the Aer Lingus again.

On this flight we were offered one meal and one breakfast bar. The staff don't ask for Water or any other beverage from time to time. I saw other passengers bringing their own food drink etc.. They are probably used to traveling on this airline and are adequately prepared. The quality of entertainment is poor and the system they use is slow to respond.

			"On Dec 18th we left Miami at 7 pm for Buenos Aires. Average flight nothing special. Arrived in Buenos Aires at 5.30 am and went to our assigned gate at the domestic terminal. We were booked on Flight 1880 to Ushuaia that was to leave at 7.45 am (12/19/13) giving 30 hours to catch our 3pm (12/20/13) Antarctic cruise. Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise. We were never offered an explanation for the postponed and cancelled flights and then were diverted to a different airport without warning or explanation. We will never travel this Airlines again.",

			'Aerolineas Argentinas provide the worst customer service that I have received from any airline. One of the internal flights was cancelled due to a strike by airport staff (Puente de Aereo - Buenos Aires). We had to queue for 6 hours to speak to a representative (during a heat wave where the temperature was close to 40 degrees C). When we did finally reach the front of the queue we were offered an alternative flight for 5 days after the original flight date and were not offered any compensation in terms of a snack or alternative accommodation. Their attitude throughout was "it\'s your problem". On our final flight back to Bogota they changed the flight time from 6.30am to 5.20am around a month before the flight. We turned up 3 hours before the flight as instructed on the ticket only to find no check-in staff present. We waited 1 hour before a single representative turned up and when I asked why staff weren\'t present to check us in at the time that we were requested to be there I was told "it\'s very early". This was another example of their attitude towards customers. As a result the flight was delayed by 2 hours. In conclusion the customer service levels at Aerolineas Argentinas is a joke.',

			'Flew 2 legs- MID-MEX on "Connect" brand and then MEX-YYZ. The MID-MEX leg was operated by an E190 no IFE and the snacks were average peanuts but the seats were comfortable and due to the length of the flight it wasn\'t important. The second leg was on a 737-700. The seats were comfortable and very nice blankets were provided however the IFE was quite limited (overhead screens that played movies and nothing else and were shut off 3 quarters into the flight) so I would recommend bringing your own entertainment if you\'re flying an Aeromexico 737. In flight meal was edible at most. Overall there were no major problems but they need to improve their IFE on longer flights and their food.',

Why does this continue? When eventually the passengers were on board (it takes forever as many cant count) we then had to listen to the captain boasting about how he was going to get us there early - of course he didn't. Cut the showing off - control the passengers hand luggage and teach them and the staff some manners. Far too expensive for this nonsense - get professional.",

I flew Aer Lingus DUB-BOS-DUB in August 2014. It has good staff reasonable planes and routes. But it is really badly let down by its archaic web site with no access to your booking or seat selection before check in tacky interiors with seat pockets hanging off cramped seats some the worst airplane food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. On my transatlantic flight I ended up sitting for 6 hours on the way out in a seat that didn't recline with the person in fronts seat wedged in my face. On the way back I was determined not to let this happen again so chose a middle aisle seat with apparently (on the online check-in website) had seats behind and in front However instead I got a lovely seat beside the toilet which didn't recline as there was a bulkhead behind not shown on their plan. Online check-in is worthless as you still have to queue up in Boston and your carefully printed ticket is torn up and binned. Overall the whole experience was so poor I would much rather go with an airline that actually wants to give passengers a reasonable experience even if it takes a few hours longer to get to my destination.",

However this trip I availed of Aer Lingus\' new service from SFO to DUB to cut out a flight. Seats were incredibly cramped and uncomfortable with very small seat pitch and minimal recline which the passenger beside me commented on also as they boarded. Food was utterly disgusting my alleged beef Stroganoff actually tasted worse than it looked which was no mean feat I didn\'t even attempt a 2nd mouthful. Wine was extra $5USD. For a long haul flight costing over $900USD one way I think this is a bit mean "breakfast" was a joke a cling film wrapped ham and cheese roll and about 100ml of water in a foil sealed plastic tub tossed out. The whole experience just felt like a cost-cutting exercise. IFE was average/poor small selection of mostly dated material.

The flight attendant explained they did not serve whisky until after lunch and that that she did not have any whisky in her cart. She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the "snack". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight. Finally while sleeping the flight attendant woke me up because the back of my seat was "bothering" the passenger behind me probably because the seat was "defective and reclined too much".

Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip.

The security personnel-the only non passengers we could access - refused to assist the passengers as we all became increasingly frustrated at the lack of information. We made phone calls to the Vienna airport (they must share the blame for this debacle as well) and Aer Lingus. No one offered any help whatsoever. Aer Lingus has apparently trained their employees to respond to any question or concern with a very irritating reply: "We understand that you are frustrated". This is all we heard from Aer Lingus employees throughout this flight. Not one Aer Lingus employee responded with appropriate action. At check in we were promised help with a seating request that I had tried to manage multiple times before arrival. No help was ever provided. The hot meal was frustrating as well.

Flight from SVO to NRT was on an A333. Nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete IFE. We had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. Crew was attentive and quitte friendy. With one hour delay we arrived at NRT. The flight from NRT back to SVO gave us however some mixed emotions. on an A333 but with a crew that wasn't as friendly as the flight to NRT. We got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. Toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. Transit from terminal D to E on SVO was a mess. At immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. Flight from SVO to AMS on an A320 was better than the flight from NRT. Aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. Toilet was also in a poor state. The crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. In the end Aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. If you don't have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is OK. At SVO you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights.

The first leg was "bearable" if a little short on snacks and food options - so much so that the first thing I did was to buy a little bag of peanuts to go in my carry on. The second leg was uncomfortable due to the shell seats which are nothing sort of a torture device. Two weeks pass before the third leg which was same seats same limited choice of movies and even the same food. The fourth leg - the entertainment system took around an hour to load. Same movies even though it was a different month! But the real issue for me was the meal. With almost every meal they serve 2 pieces of bread. The white "loaf" is always icy cold and hard. The little brown slice was also cold and hard. There was not enough butter for both. Given the price I paid for my ticket I didn\'t expect gourmet food but the piece of salmon was literately the size of a teaspoon. The chicken was barely warm. Usually the food is served piping hot and even if the bread is not heated if you leave your roll on top of your main meal you can get a bit of heat and steam into it. No such luck. The dessert - there was nothing to eat it with in the utensil pack was exactly what it looked like tasteless overly sweet faux cream.

I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music.

			"Traveling with my children from NY to Córdoba via Buenos Aires. The NYC-EZE flight was delayed more than 8 hours. Luckily they emailed me before I set off to JFK airport. The problem is that they forgot that we had a connecting flight and did not make any provisions at all. Calling the Call Center to try to find out what to expect once in Ezeiza (stranded for 24 hours with two young kids? sent to a hotel? put in a different flight from the domestic airport?) was total waste of time. They don't even bother to pick up the phone. In summary: only fly Aerolineas Argentinas if no other option is available. They are unreliable have no customer service whatsoever and will not hesitate to leave you stranded. And never expect an apology.",

Service is pleasant and professional without trying to be cute during announcements.

The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty!

I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter.

			'The flight from Sydney to Buenos Aires was awful - the food was disgusting the toilets were not cleaned for hours - hence the smell. No entertainment other than outdated TV hanging from ceiling distorted picture and mainly in another language that could not understand. Seat in front of me was broken and was on a constant lean. The staff or should I say lack of it spent more time talking to one another or reading a magazine than attending to the passengers. The flight home was no better - it might of been cheaper but had I known what they were like I would of gladly paid the extra and flew with Qantas. I would not recommend that you fly with this airline I certainly will not.',

			'I really think this airline is sadly overlooked in the US market. I took a chance on them a few years back when United dropped direct flights to places in Mexico I visit and found an airline with great service modern planes and competitive prices. The flight schedules are convenient and the staff I have encountered have been friendly and helpful when I have needed them. Only once have I had a issue due to weather - and they made sure to get me on another flight and while my bags did not make it on the plane they had them secured and waiting for me the next morning. In the past 3 years I have flown with them 10+ times and have no interest in looking elsewhere.',

			'LHR-SNN 17th June 2014. I used to travel Aer Lingus on this route quite regularly however since experiencing the leg room on the A319 I see no reason now to chose Aer Lingus over Ryanair when travelling from London to Shannon. I am 6\'1" and I literally could not fit my legs in to the seat. Luckily I was in the aisle however kept having to squeeze my legs in when the trolley came past. I am aware these are former Iberia aircraft hence the reason for the difference between the leg room in the A320 and the A319 however I feel Aer Lingus should have reconfigured the A319 to provide a consistent product between aircraft. I travelled in row 7 on the outbound leg of this journey (which was the former business class area for Iberia) and had more than enough leg room. Beware of travelling in the rear of the aircraft on the A319. Very unpleasant flight and I just about managed to put up with it for the hour duration of this flight. I could not imagine sitting in these seats for any longer.',

The stewards were very nice and the crew were funny even in announcements.

			'TLV-SVO and SVO-RIX. TLV-SVO was on a new A330. As is typical of the former USSR the boarding announcement was met by a scrum of people rushing the boarding gate. No attempt made by the crew to regulate boarding and as a result it took nearly an hour. Once onboard the flight attendants were generally sour and the food was stale and lukewarm. In-flight entertainment was surprisingly good but still a step down from Delta and similar airlines. Despite TLV-SVO being an overnight flight the cabin lights were never dimmed and the service was staggered in a way that essentially prevented all sleeping. Could not figure this out. SVO was pleasant enough and SVO-RIX was an easy short-hop on a new 737. No service and no complaints.

One thing that could be improved and that's the headphones : they do not give ear cushions and so wearing headphones is very uncomfortable even painful to ears sometimes. The sound quality is also terrible. Quite a pleasant experience on both flights and I will use Aeroflot again.

But the boarding process could and should have been organized in a better way. Wonder why the jetbridge hasn't been used. No such problems on the return flight. Both flights on A320 pretty comfortable seats decent space. Training of the staff should clearly be improved first and foremost the language skills and attitude towards passengers. At the same time a young flight assistant on the return flight at least tried to be friendly and attentive. The food was inedible on the first flight and acceptable on the way back. Entertainment should be enhanced ie. by installation of individual multimedia sets in short and medium-haul aircrafts. All in all the general experience is pretty average. The ticket price was actually quite low compared to other offers for these dates considering the flexibility in the choice of flights and the level of seat comfort is pretty good but the main thing is that Aeroflot should be training the staff harder if they want to improve their international profile. Also basing on my experience of traveling with this airline I can say that the quality of in-flight service can differ dramatically on different flights so it is sometimes really a matter of luck.",

			'Gatwick to Joburg (troubles just beginning to brew in Libya). The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them.

Could not check in online as we had not booked directly with airline which meant an early start at the airport and no seats together. BRS-DUB with Stobart and a tiny noisy twin-prop as you might expect for such a short flight. DUB-YYZ plane looked brand new - think this route had only just started flying - and was full. 3-3 configuration felt very cramped. Drinks and food OK but not served until about 2 hours into the flight and no pre-landing snacks left by the time they got to us on the back row - we were offered a selection of biscuits instead. Service was fine apart from this. IFE selection limited and touchscreen system somewhat temperamental. Not a full-service airline so alcoholic drinks had to be paid for (we were prepared and brought euros just for this). On return YQG-YYZ sector by Air Canada - checked bags through to BRS for us. YYZ-DUB was a night flight but drinks and food again served after 2 hours water on board not working so no tea or coffee (or water in the toilets) lights not dimmed at all though a blanket and pillow were provided. Flight seemed to be on time leaving but arrived 30 mins late though no there was no mention of this or apology from the crew. It was only on the very long walk from the gate that we realised there'd been a delay and had to run then be fast- tracked through security just getting to the gate for our connecting flight as it closed behind us. Needless to say our bags didn't follow us for a couple of days. You get what you pay for and Aer Lingus were a little cheaper and a lot more convenient than other airlines for us. For a 7hr flight they were fine and I might be tempted by the convenience of the DUB US immigration pre-clearance to fly to NYC or Boston with them but I wouldn't travel any further.",

I was apprehensive above flying Aer Lingus based on previous reviews. The BHX-DUB sector was on an Aer Arran (now Stobart Air) ATR which was practically empty with overhead bins that accommodated carry- on's but the aircraft was very noisy. DUB-JFK was an A330 in 2-4-2 configuration. Seats and leg room were ok. Seat back TV entertainment was limited and not the most user friendly. Alcoholic beverages have to be paid for and there was only one round of soft drinks. The meal was mediocre and the pre-arrival snack was a flapjack. The crew constantly seemed in a hurry to distribute meals and drinks to the point where they practically chucked it at you before moving on. The crew then disappeared not to be seen until arrival. Whenever I fly transatlantic in economy I always seem to be disappointed. Nothing beats the middle eastern carriers on service. The only benefit of flying Aer Lingus is leaving from a local airport and the US pre-immigration clearance in Dublin which enables one to arrive in the US like a domestic passenger and avoid the lengthy immigration queues. Price however is comparable to other carriers.",

Aeromexico told me that the notification must be a mistake because they see no changes in their system and all flights are according to original reservation. As proof they even sent me a copy of electronic ticket which really showed all the correct departure times. Also checking the Aeromexico site there was no indication of any delay.

They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.',

It was almost funny how clueless they were! Staff were friendly but no idea of customer service or professionalism. The quality of the food seems to be dependant of the airport you last left leaving SA or the UK the food was ok with a North African theme but when we left Tripoli the food was inedible. The flights are dry so they only serve warm juice or soda. The movies are heavily censored at first it's quite amusing but it gets irritating after a while. Woman's shoulders are blurred out and they even censor out all references to alcohol or gambling but blood death & murder are all good! Tripoli Airport is awful you can barely breath for the smoke and there's no organisation it's like going back it time.",

Seats were the standard for medium haul although getting off the seat to walk can be cumbersome for those on the window seats. Meals were OK. Purser was courteous but distant. Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in.

Anyone who knows SVO terminal knows that it is overburdened chaotic and in dire need of an overhaul. We made our connecting flight (no thanks to the indifferent Aeroflot ground personnel) only because the aircraft was late arriving in Moscow. That said we still had to run through the terminal. Flights on SU were surprisingly good with comfortable seating choice of well catered meals and cabin attendants who were very professional and friendly. This airline has really upped their game on long haul international flights. In fact I dare say there are equal to if not better than many of their European competitors.

I was pleasantly surprised by the in-flight entertainment which had a modern touch-screen interface and seemed to be reliable. Legroom was good. For me the only negative issue really was Tripoli Airport. The departure lounge is small and not very comfortable. There were people smoking despite "no smoking" signs. Maybe smoking is only allowed in certain areas but the smoke carries everywhere. The toilets are in serious need of modernisation too. I was glad I didn\'t have to spend long there.

It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there.

I almost missed the bus over to the morning flight only for the fact that a ground staff called out 'anyone else for Bristol'.

The biggest problem here was the handling agent in Schiphol apparently Aeroflot took the cheapest option out of available and all the issues such as slow poorly trained staff and poor co- ordination with airport services - everything is delayed all the time and every time (I took over 10 Aeroflot flights from AMS during the last two years). No entertainment system. SVO-KJA on the same day was served by a brand new B777. A decent entertainment system but not much space in the economy cabin. KJA-SVO-AMS was served by A319 and 320 - everything described for the A321 on the AMS-SVO route applies here as well. Business-class check- in in KJA was a very strange procedure but in does not have to do with Aeroflot I guess (although my experience with their KJA agents was thoroughly unpleasant so probably they just do not care to check how those procedure work). Safety training of the crew seems to be a very big issue. They just could not care less. Their usual passengers are not very disciplined in general but the crew just does not act on this at all. Food was good on all the legs although the beverages were a bit below average though - juice and wines were really bad (alcohol only on international legs). Transfer in SVO from Terminal F international to terminal D domestic (and especially back) is still a big problem. Poor information little help from staff. When you are transferring from D to F you really shall look around carefully at each turn (there lots of them) - once you skip a little half-hidden pointer - you are running into a wrong spot and getting through security control (double!) all over again. No SkyPriority service in the Terminal F except business class check-in counters and a VERY poor tiny and shabby business lounge.',

Take-off was smooth and the flight was good. A few hours into the flight breakfast and coffee were served. I did not partake because I was asleep (a special thank you to the flight attendant for not waking me up). Flight attendants were courteous respectful and polite.

BCN-Dublin is basically a low cost flight curiously more comfortable than the 757 they used for the transatlantic leg. This must be the narrowest twin-engine plane around very narrow seats (and I'm on the slim side) and little legroom on top of that. I heard many people commenting on the lack of space. The personal entertainment system is not bad although only a few recent releases plus some shows and documentaries and music and maps. Food on the outbound flight was awful and made me ill afterwards so I avoided it on the inbound and brought my own food. Drinks service is seriously cheap no free alcohol and just water orange juice or Coke/Sprite available. Crew was friendly but never followed up on the one occasion (each flight) I went to the galley to ask for something even though they said they'd bring it to my seat. Transfer at Dublin was easy but with a lot of walking. I won't fly this particular route with them again.",

Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people.

It was a late night arrival past 11pm but there was still the hassle of getting off the plane and riding a bus to the terminal. I thought all Aegean jets were not using the tube seeing several of their planes parked in the tarmac at some distance from the terminal.

We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.",

			"Travelled LHR-ATH Business Class then ATH-JMK (Mykonos) all Economy. Flight boarding was fine seats the usual European system with centre seat left empty and centre of the seat folded down to form a table. Was offered pre take-off drinks i.e. half a plastic glass of orange juice or one inch of sparkling white wine again in a plastic glass. The drink service was equally mean when ordering a glass of white wine less than half a glass was offered. The meal service was chaotic with only the female cabin manager looking after the 15 B/C passengers. We were booked through to Mykonos with an hours transit time (not enough). We landed and were put on a bus to the terminal then clearing immigration (bags booked through to final destination) we joined the horrendous queue for security through to the domestic flight. The queue took 40 minutes and we made the connection by the skin of our teeth. Not a very relaxing way to start a vacation. On the return flights JMK-ATH was fine only taking 24 minutes. The flight from Athens was full 16 Business Class Passengers and again the service and the quality of the food really let Aegean Airlines down. The cabin crew on both International sectors were out of their depth service was slow and mean in quantity and quality. The return main meal was the worst we've ever had on an aircraft ever.",

			"Sydney to Buenos Aires and return in April 2013 in business class. Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.",

We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane.

			"Today I was scheduled to fly from Mexico City to LAX but I was connecting from another city. Aeromexico screwed up the connection so I missed my leg to LAX. Instead of simply rebooking me on a later flight (of which there were three) they wanted to reticket me and charge me the then rate which was $650 more than I had originally paid. Seriously? You want me to pay $650 for your mistake. Worse when I said I'd fly Alaska instead they didn't care - but refused to refund me my original money for the MEX to LAX leg. This is the second such instance with this airline. Two years ago I was making the same trip and also was not able to complete the leg from MEX to LAX. They said there was \"weather problems\" in LA. (My family was at the airport in LA at the time and said it was clear as day and gorgeous weather). So they cancelled my flight to LAX and I was told I couldn't get on another flight until the next day. They made me pay for my hotel room at the Mexico City airport because it was a weather delay (which it wasn't) and was beyond their control. Worse I had purchased an upgrade to First Class earlier in the day (before the flight was cancelled) and when the First Class cabin was not available on the flight the next day they wouldn't refund my First Class upgrade cost even though they were going to put me in Coach. So when I got home I filed suit in Small Claims Court and I won the cost of the hotel and the First Class upgrade cost.",

Every single sandwich and snack has one type of cheese or another added even on the pre-order meals it's a choice of cheese or more cheese.

The airplanes are good however the transit service is really poor this might be because of the airport it is hard to figure out your flight gate and it is complicated to get information from the staff. Waiting hours are awful I expected to get some sort of cabin or something upon arrival but sleeping on the floor buying your own drinks is about it.

If they know of this whole ordeal why would they sell flights with such short layovers? Food and service: Most staff were pleasant. The food was pretty decent and free drinks even alcoholic ones. The flight didn't have individual screens so there's only one movie option. They did have radio and gave headphones a pillow and a blanket. Overall it wasn't a bad experience. As a side note if you have a connection through Mexico airport and are pressed for time make sure you ask the personnel if you can't find something as its lacking some signs.

			"Dublin-CDG return this was on a flex fare so not really in business class as such as business class is non existent on short haul flights. While the service from the cabin crew was friendly and efficient I note several issues that management needs to address. Flex fare entitles you to access to airport lounges. This needs to be made stress free for passengers. This time I received the invitation by email but as I had changed the dates as I am entitled to do I used the original lounge invitation (as no new invitation came by e-mail). No problems encountered in Dublin but while in Paris the staff in the Icare lounge came back to me while I was sitting down and eating to verify that the original lounge invitation reference matched my flight reference. I don't blame her as she was very apologetic for having had to do so. Surely if this is an issue for ground staff Aer Lingus should send a new invitation when you change the dates. In some previous flights the invitation did not come at all and Aer Lingus did not reply to my queries and there were issues getting access to the lounge without this \"invitation\". Perhaps Aer Lingus does not really bother with this as most people don't really bother with paying the higher flex fares. However for those who pay they should get what they pay for without any stress. I would also suggest that if you pay this fare you should at least be entitled to one meal and one drink on your flight since the fare costs 3 to 4 times more the cheaper fares. I will continue to use Aer Lingus as I live in Ireland and I find their cabin crew generally friendly and efficient but I hope management takes note of my comments and suggestions. If they don't address these issues they may find more and more people opt for their competitors like Ryanair.",

			'Roundtrip from Dulles International Airport to the Czech Republic stopping in Moscow. Dissatisfaction is the word that came to mind repeatedly during these series of flights. The food was excellent. Served on time and hot on each of these flights. Very consistent. The cost was excellent compared to other airlines offering the same trip. It was downhill from there. Of the total 4 flights required to make this trip zero were on time. Every single flight left late. This is clearly a normal practice for this Airline based on my experience. The initial flight to Moscow from Dulles (10 hours or so) had no working video displays for entertainment. There was working music but the headphone connector on the seat was shorted and would barley play sound in mono and only if held in a certain position. After landing and proceeding to the terminal in Moscow there was complete chaos. The airport appeared to be clean and new with lots of English signage however some of the people working in the terminal seemed to be avoiding anything that resembled being helpful. Most seemed to have attitudes for some reason. Russian passengers herded like cattle to the tiniest security checkpoint area that I have ever seen. There were 4 lanes for 300 people. The return flight was worse. After I reached Moscow from the Czech Republic there was more herding to the security checkpoint. This time a customs representative sat at a desk near by reading a book as a few hundred people waited in lines that barley moved. I asked the person reading the book if I was standing in a special line or something since the signs were not in English she responded that I should find another line in a tone that indicated the I was disturbing her. I eventually wasted an hour before I discovered that I was in the area of customs for domestic flights and not international. The International flight area took 3 minutes to process. This theme of herding and poor manners played out at every airport except for the final destination back in the US. I will never fly Aeroflot again. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.',

			"Moscow-Hong Kong flight was well below my expectations. Terminal F has been revamped with too many shops and not enough seats. Passengers camped on the stairs and the floor. As there were other flights to China departing from nearby gates almost at the same time one can only imagine the pushing shouting and queue-jumping. Allocating more space to people and less to shops would help address the problem. We boarded on time but some passengers had so many duty-free shopping bags that overhead storage soon reached maximum capacity. Tempers flared departure was delayed. I had to keep my backpack under the seat thus reducing that precious little space. After takeoff we were told that the entertainment system was out of order. No films no music no games. nothing. I had ordered a vegetarian meal at the time of buying the ticket online 6 months earlier and this is usually a very tasty Asian- style hot meal. This time my name didn't appear on the flight attendants' list despite being clearly indicated in the electronic ticket in my possession. Flight attendants ignored the issue and just apologized for the mistake. The best they could offer was a normal tray with two small salads instead of one. A few hours later when they served breakfast I realised that 2 out of 3 standard options were ok for vegetarians. Why wasn't a breakfast tray offered to me at dinner time? Flight attendants started serving tea and coffee. Due to turbulence they had to stop serving hot drinks and at least 100 passengers were left without any hot beverages to accompany their breakfast. The turbulence ended but serving hot beverages was never resumed. All in all not the best experience.",

The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over.

Check in was very slow on all flights.

The arm rests don't fold all the way back so you have to be a circus contortionist to get out of your seat. Two people cannot pass one another even if they're going sideways. An older gentleman literally fell into what was luckily an empty seat trying to get back to his seat. The flight attendants were pleasant enough except for one male who thought he was \"large and in charge\". The food was the usual stuff basically it was edible.

			'A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.',

Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.",

			'3/4/2014 flight to Dublin. 3 of our group were flying from LAX and one was flying from Denver. Both flights had less than 2 hours layover in Chicago. Since you have to change terminals and go through security again this layover is just unacceptable. The LAX group barely made the flight. It was almost fully boarded when we got to the gate and we did not dilly dally at all. The flight from Denver was 20 minutes late. Our friend and 5 other people ran from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5 and arrived at the gate at 5 minutes before takeoff time. All 6 passengers were denied boarding. They watched the plane pull away from the gate. The exasperating thing is that the Aer Lingus staff at the gate take no responsibility and show no empathy for this issue. It should be noted that we arrived in Dublin 1.5 hours early. So waiting 5 minutes to board those 6 passengers would not have impacted the arrival at all. Then to make it worse on our return flight they canceled my friends upgraded meal. Their logic was "well you weren\'t on the flight to Dublin for your upgraded meal so we canceled your return meal". I agree with the post about the seat arm rest not going up. Not because you can\'t spread out but because you cannot get out of your seat to go to the bathroom. Bottom line never again and I would not recommend Aer Lingus to anyone.',

Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC.

Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof. Breakfast on the 13 hour long-haul consisted of two pieces of cold bread and a banana. Much cheaper than LAN but definitely not worth the money paid.',

			"Was booked on the flight on the 13th of July from EZE-SYD (which does not go via AKL anymore). I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers. Their compensation was not good either and I (and several others) decided we wanted a full refund.",

Our flight was on time so I expected to be ok - but quickly saw that I had a long wait in Customs. It took over an hour to get through that line-up. Carried my bag as fast as I could up to the area where connecting flights were to drop bags off - and to another line-up. The rep working there told me it was too late to catch my flight to Merida. It hadn\'t left but doors were closed. She told me to go and get a new flight across the hall. When I arrived there the rep told me that I must buy a new ticket. I was shocked. No other airline has ever made me pay for a new connection when I have been held up in a Customs line-up. Even the supervisor on shift would not bend. I could not believe this airline would treat a customer so badly. I had run as fast as possible between customs and baggage check-in - only to be told by the unfriendly agent that "1.5 hours is enough time" to catch my flight. So I paid for a new ticket - no choice! What stung even more was the feeling that AeroMexico just didn\'t care what happened to their customer arriving alone in a strange city. Never again.',

Bus stopped about a hundred metres from the steps to the aircraft as the heavens opened. 50 people ran at once to try to escape the deluge. Utter chaos and appalling management by Aeroflot. Cabin crew were singularly unhelpful saying to a passenger who complained "it\'s not our decision". It took a good half hour from when the door was closed to take off which added to the frustration of the delay. But once airborne things took a turn for the better. The Cain crew were personable and efficient. Dinner was served promptly and was tasty. Impressive too was the nutritional information next to each dish - calories protein carbohydrates. The Italian red wine was more drinkable than many I\'ve had elsewhere. IFE was via individual players that were handed out after a polite request. Reasonable selection of films. Spent a further frustrating 30 minutes in the hold before landing 90 minutes late. Luggage took another 20 or so - definitely not treated as priority.

			'I am an Algerian living the south East of England for last 24 years. My family and I use to fly Air Algerie from London to Algiers about twice a year. The service and the London office became so bad that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket. When Air Algerie was the only airline flying to Algeria people had to travel to London to buy their tickets. In the last few years more European airlines started to fly to Algeria. A lot of Algerians living in the UK prefer to fly Algeria via a connecting flight (Rome Milan and Paris) than flying with Air Algerie. The price of the ticket was in most cases more expensive. More recently BA started flying to Algiers from London and this provide us an alternative option. My family and most of our friends fly with BA with travelling to London. I think Air Algerie provides better food than BA but the FA on the BA flights project a more professional image.',

Food service is also always hit a miss outbound I was able to buy a breakfast offering on return nothing was available. Also I note the seat belt sign seems to stay on unusually longer than any other airline probably to keep passengers seated longer in order for service prep. Seats are comfortable for short haul leather but starting to wear slightly. Gold Circle club is a waste of time. At Dublin I attempted to check in at a computer terminal with my passport and told to report to a physical desk for check in. Oh joy huge queues luckily I tried another machine and it worked fine.

Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing.

I cannot understand why anyone would want to purchase an extra bag without wanting extra weight. I assumed I would be allowed 40kg when I booked the extra bag but I was still only allowed 20kg which would have been the same weight as if I had not booked the extra bag. I am sure that a lot of other passengers fall for this! In all fairness Aer Lingus is a good airline to fly light. They have very competitive prices if you travel light but it can cost you your shirt and pants literally if you are over weight. I almost had to pay 300 Euro in over weight fess.

During this time the crew had better things to do than hand out any water or other liquid refreshment it seems.

We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF.

Late take off due to passengers being selfish and hogging the overhead bins and generally being thoroughly stupid with regards to the basics such as sitting down quickly and being able to count from 1 to 29.

Rather it would have been a good deal if Aer Lingus didn't end up charging my $521 for two more tickets to return home. After getting a little lost in Dublin we arrived at the airport with a little over an hour before our departure time. When we tried to check in at the kiosk it said check-in was closed. The attendant directed us to the check-in desk. They told us check-in had closed 15 minutes ago. When I pointed out that there were no lines at security and that an hour would still be plenty of time to get to our flight they still refused to let me check in and sent me to another desk to find another flight. The frustrating thing was I presumably would have been allowed to check in on the kiosk if I had been there 15 minutes earlier but I still could have had to wait in line to check my bags. That was not the case. I was able to walk right up to the desk because the airport was not very busy. When I went to the customer service desk we still had 55 minutes before our departure. Told they could get us to the U.S. that night but we'd have to find our own connections but she was not willing to quote the price of those other options. As it turns out it looks like Aer Lingus sold our seats out from under us. Yes I suppose I should have arrived earlier but I've made long haul flights before with less time to spare.

Clearing customs and immigration in Dublin is a real plus. American customs and immigration are rude and hostile but about what you would expect from them.',

			'JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop. Great job all round.',

			"DUB-ORD and return. Both flights on Airbus 330-300. Seating seemed tight in both width and legroom compared with other airlines we have used. We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer. Overall it was as good as economy gets on European airlines although not anything like as good as the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Would fly with them again.",

			'DUB-DUS-DUB. Outbound flight light load had breakfast not bad value and quite tasty. Remote stand in DUS but efficient transfer via bus so no complaints. So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.',

			'PRG-SVO-BKK. A smooth flight to SVO on a newish A320. Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there\'s plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the "First class" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered. IFE system with proper wide screens offers sufficient amount of entertainment apart from the choice in music. All in all a very positive experience with Aeroflot. Would certainly fly Aeroflot again.',

The LED-SVO leg even had the bonus of the purser giving a brief of what one could see or do in Moscow. The meal services on both legs were conducted at lightning speed which I initially found worrisome as I was only halfway through my ARN-SVO meal when I saw the crew collecting the trays four rows away but I did see that the mainly Russian and Swedish passengers were already done eating so it was probably my pace that was the issue.

We sat in the airport take off lounge waiting for an hour. finally after lots of noise made by the passengers a representative from Air Arabia arrived. She tried to convince the passengers but could not give a proper reply. At around 0030hrs the manager arrived and said that a spare part was coming from Sharjah in the morning flight 4:45am and that the flight was rescheduled to leave at 7am. No other compensation was offered to the customers. Some took the offer to cancel their flight while the rest who waited in the lounge were stranded without any offer from Air Arabia. Finally at around 3am after much heated discussion fried rice was offered to all. After that till 7:45am no staff from Air Arabia was present. When they came they again said that the flight was delayed no breakfast was offered. finally after much arguments we took off around 10.30am a long wait in the airport with no compensation!

For instance when departing Algiers all passengers must identify their luggage which is laid out on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. For this I have no problem. The latest I have ever been leaving Algiers is 45 minutes. It gives me ample time to catch any connecting flights to my next destination. The other reason why they are quite often delayed flying back to Algiers is because there are simply not enough parking spots at the Airport in for incoming flights therefore they wait in Paris Rome Frankfurt etc until a spot can be allocated for the aircraft. The crew is always more than accommodating with refreshments and anything they can do to assist with comfort. They have eliminated smoking on the flights but some people still light up. When this happens they tell the person to put out the cigarette and if the person refuses they are told that should they refuse to extinguish the cigarette - then once they arrivedat the destination the local authorities will be contacted this usually takes care of the problem.',

Felt tricked as I was not given this information at the time of booking. In-flight entertainment non existent no personal video screens and unclean airplane on the way into JFK. Movie was shown on an overhead screen unfortunately the headphones provided were non functional. The food was horrible and neither me nor my wife ate the food no baby food provided for my infant. The only positive from the flight was that the plane was empty and we could place our baby on the seat between us. It would have been very hard to carry the baby on our lap for 5 hours without a bassinet. On the return flight check-in was a mess at JFK the staff were not efficient and when we asked if the flight was on time we were told it was. We rushed through security and when we reached the gate the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The airline staff were not competent and no one could explain the reason for the delay.

			'Flew from Madrid to Mexico City. First off my flight was delayed for reasons that none of the staff at the desk was able to explain. Check in was extremely disorganised and poorly signaled. About 1 hour into 14 hour flight I noticed that my inflight entertainment screen was still off while other passengers\' screens were on. Then it turned out that 6 rows did not have working inflight entertainment screens or overhead reading lights. As soon as we let the staff know they told us they would "reset the system" and let people at the front of the plane know. About 30 minutes later nothing was working and we asked again what the status was. We were told quite rudely that they were looking into it. Needless to say this carried on for another 3 hours. It became evident that the flight attendants were avoiding our section as we could see them walking around offering water to passengers in the aisle on the other side of the plane quite often. Finally about 4.5 hours into the flight the person sitting next to me asked once more whether they\'d managed to see what was wrong with our screens. The flight attendant said "well obviously it\'s not working. Didn\'t you figure that out?". I can understand that technical problems may arise but that does not mean that paying customers should be treated rudely. I was very happy to finally land in Mexico city after 14 hours of a tortuous flight. I am very hesitant to fly with Aeromexico again if this is the standard of customer service that they have.',

The seats are atrocious and some of them were broken. Mine were broken on both flights (headrest wouldn't stay and the tray table was squeaky and uneven). The service is more or less ok quite a lot of smiles although crew disappeared right after the meal for 8 hours. They answered the calls quickly so not really a problem. The meal was mediocre quality hit or miss catering from Hong Kong significantly better than from Moscow. They ran out of meal options on both flights pretty quickly. IFE screen was malfunctioning on both flights although after they restarted it it worked flawlessly. The system is pretty slow but I liked the movie selection. Aeroflot misinformed us twice on the gate we were arriving to which made it hard to greet us at the right terminal. They also decided that the bus is good enough to deliver the huge crowd of 300+ passengers to the terminal. Overall the experience was poor especially because of the seat pitch problem and broken seats. I must say Aeroflot is quite good on short- haul and medium-haul European flights but I would never take a long-haul with them again - the seats the delays and overall service leaves a lot to be desired and the overall feel is Aeroflot doesn't care about its customers at all.",

I was waiting for over an hour before I got to the counter. I asked for a window and got a middle seat (they said they had no more windows). I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know. Back in Sharjah the immigration area is confusingly laid out and getting a queue that moves is pot luck. here again everyone is pushing to get served.

All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard.

			"Airport staff refused to relay flight information in English to all English speaking customers. Mexico City airport is poorly labelled and difficult to find your way around. When we asked staff for help or directions we were given different directions each time. Since we has a 12 delay due to yet another flight cancellation we tested this hypothesis on a 7 staff members. When we originally selected our flights to Costa Rica this airline offered the best route. Flight times were great no more than 2 hour layovers and we were to reach our destination in less than 9 hours. By the time this airline finished canceling and delaying all our flights it took us over 30 hours to reach our destination. Total fight time was only 6.5 hours. Plus we were given immigration documentation in Spanish only and told it didn't come in English.",

			'GRU-MEX-LAX roundtrip. GRU-MEX on B777-200 comfortable aircraft good legroom individual but limited IFE. Offered complimentary alcoholic beverages but meals were inedible. MEX-LAX on B737-700 fair legroom. Aeromexico has an odd confusing boarding procedure - instead of using boarding groups based on seat rows just like most of airlines they call passengers by seat type: window middle or aisle. That means if you are travelling with relatives or acquaintances boarding will have to be individual. If you consider connecting through Mexico City be aware that no matter the destination is you will have to go through immigration and customs. So think twice if your final destination is the US.',

Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.",

			'I flew on a flight from Cork to Paris yesterday and to my horror I was scolded by ground staff that my baggage was overweight. I was shocked because I bought a more expensive ticket that allowed me to carry 2 bags. However in the fine print of Aer Lingus it states that whether you carry one or two bags the maximum weight allowable is 20kg. This makes absolutely no sense in having 2 bags of 10kg since the bag itself weights about 2kg to 3 kg so you lose out if you carry 2 bags. Your total weight allowance shrinks from 20kg to 17kg if you carry one bag and if you carry two bags it shrinks from 20kg to 14kg as the 2 bags will weigh 6kg in total. So I paid extra money for absolutely nothing. I thought that when you paid extra money you will be allowed to carry 2 bags of 20kg each (totalling to 40kg). This is the worse thing I found about Aer Lingus. I had to pay EUR75 for 5 kg overweight. Also this flight had no business class and I had taken the highest class available called Economy Class Flexi Fare. Even my Star Alliance Gold Card was not useful.',

New livery on the planes is really great. On the downside choice of films on the IFE is surprisingly limited and most French films - and seats are really narrow because of 3-4-3 configuration on B777 particularly exit seats.

AVOD was average - not the greatest selection but enough to please. Transfer at SVO was very easy. Lounge at SVO was average - ok food drinks and good wifi. SVO-TXL on an A320. Immaculate condition of plane and the staff/inflight meals were excellent for a 2.5 hour flights. FAs handed out portable players for flight which is great. Very impressive short-haul service. Overall an excellent value for money considering most of the other carriers were charging more for an economy seat.',

Inflight entertainment system very good however mine was broken after 4 hours on flight to Havana. Restarting the system helped but then the handset stopped working as well so the system was useless. Cabin crew polite and helpful. Big minus for the food which was awful. Beverages were good although there was no alcohol on this route. Very difficult to understand the "Russian" English during the announcements. My rating of the flights reflects very much the impact of poor food (which is important during the 12 hrs flight) the rest was very good especially the price.',

			"Heathrow to Almaty return via Astana in Business Class. This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus! Overall we enjoyed our experience with Air Astana perhaps more so than we were expecting and given that they are often keenly priced I would recommend them.",

			'Moscow - Astana - Almaty - Bangkok. Two of the three sectors were very late at night or early morning and I chose sleep rather than food. It seemed a little strange serving dinner at about 2.00am! It would be better to offer breakfast when flights depart after 11.30 at night. Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules. The flight from Moscow was delayed for about an hour because of a technical problem. We were promptly advised by the crew of nature of the problem and the likely time needed to fix it.',

Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapés salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage. IFE good although they seemed to have dimmed the brightness of the screen recently so you may need to close the window blind to watch.

A bit more food is available from the bar for extra pay.

			'Mexico City to Narita thru Tijuana. At check-in I requested for check-thru for my baggage but the man in the counter said it is not possible. I got alarmed when my other colleagues (we were in a group reservation) baggage were checked-thru. I had to recall from baggage and made to baggage drop for check-thru to Manila via Narita. Mexico City to Tijuana leg we were assigned a seat number - 14E which did not exist. So they found us seats on row 22. When we reached Tijuana we stayed on board and we asked if we needed to change seats as we were given boarding pass with different seat assignments. Again I was assigned seat 12A which still does not exist in the plane. We were made to sit in other seats and we had to bring our blankets and earphones because they do not issue fresh ones. We had connecting flights in Narita for our trip to Manila. When we got to Manila our baggage did not come with us. For 2 days we tracked our delayed baggage and learned they were not loaded apparently when we left Mexico.',

			'London Heathrow - ORK. Fly regularly on this route - such a great alternative to other low cost airlines. Flight took off from London early and arrived early and same for the return. Cabin crew friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Food for purchase was good value and tasty. I have flown over 20 times with Aer Lingus and never had a bad experience. Assigned seating comfortable seats and great crew - makes flying a breeze.',

			'BHX-DUB day return 15 June 2013. As a fearful flyer trying to overcome it this was a pair of practice flights for me. Flight attendants could not have been more helpful and supportive especially as they are really busy on short flight. A320s were great and though it was a gusty crosswind day for landings never felt anything but safe and supported. One attendant even provided me with some extra reading material in case I needed it to help distract me and even bought me a drink from the trolley! Was not expecting such above and beyond service. Do airlines realise how much of a good impression caring cabin crew give? Will definitely be flying with this airline again!',

			'LHR-SVO-ULN return. I have flown this route 6 times over the last couple of months. This is by far the fastest way to Mongolia from London but am fed up by the last of customer service and inability to transit luggage through SVO. The planes from LHR to SVO are generally new and clean. Onward from Moscow the planes are ancient although the business class seats recline flat. The food is always the same - just about edible in business class. Out of my last 4 journeys my luggage has been lost 3 times. Going to give up with Aeroflot and fly Korean air via Seoul now. Via Moscow might be quick but the total lack of customer service wears very thin after a while.',

Food was very good. it was a nice flight. SVO-IST(321) 1 hour delay. It's not bad. BEG-SVO (320) Check in started 2 hours before the flight. Lounge was good. CAs were friendly. Food was good. SVO-NRT(333) Connection was smooth. Newest 333's seat was very comfortable for sleep. Not sliding down. Cabin was clean. CAs were very friendly. Food was excellent. It was a quite nice flight.

The food was just ok and the cabin crew never even smiled once or were standing at the door with leaving the plane. I say over all they need to improve on customer service and update the planes a little.',

Online-Check-In efficient baggage-drop-off at the counter - no queues. We had to leave Thessalonika before 6pm because of the strikes. Plane arrived late so they really did a good job to turn the plane around in 20 mins. Cabin clean proper looking. Comfortable seating. Great service with a warm meal and a wide choice of beverages. Staff unbelievably friendly and helpful. Arrived on time. Great!',

			'Paris CDG-Athens. Arrived early at the checkin counter to be told to go away as I was 30 mins early when we did check in there was a queue and things were really slow due to being a terminal. Then because we had excess baggage (which took 20 mins to determine) we had to pay at another counter...20 mins to do that!!!! Then back to checkin counter for another 30 mins delay. All in all after arriving 2.8 hrs before flight departure we got to the departure gate 20 mins before boarding. A complete and utter shambles. Flight though was excellent! Cabin crew were attentive meal good and aircraft/cabin condition clean and modern.',

On the long haul flight meals are quite good and there are quite a lot of things on the platter. Before landing a snack is served. Sandwiches and beverages are provided during the whole flight. On short haul drinks only are served. Flight attendants are quite efficient but can barely speak English fluently. No individual screens.',
